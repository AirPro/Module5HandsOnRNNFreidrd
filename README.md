# Module5HandsOnRNNFreidrd
## From our Deep Learning Class, Module 5 Hands-On Assignment, Recurrent Neural Networks <br>
In this Module 5 section we are taking a look at the Recurrent neural Netowkrs, speciffically 3 types. <br>
BRNN's are temporal and process data thatinvoles time, language, and other casses. <br>
Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks: Depending on prior elements. Back propagation. <br>
These can have exploding and/or expanding gradient problems. <br>
LSTM's are Long short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks <br>
LSTM's involve forgetting input and/or output depending on configuration. <br>
GRU's are Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Networks <br>
GRU's use hidden states to process data instead of gates: Rest Gate / Update Gate (2 types)
